# 🥋 Kata Word Wrap

## 📝 Description

This kata is about wrapping words in a string. The goal is to write a function that takes a string and a number `n` and
returns a new string that contains the original string with line breaks inserted at just the right places to make sure
no line is longer than `n` characters.
